- Conduct a comprehensive market analysis of Vitraya (https://www.vitraya.com/), focusing on its history, growth trajectory, product offerings, technological capabilities, customer base, and recent funding rounds. Present your findings in a detailed report with supporting data and references.
- Design and develop a fully functional calculator web application featuring all numeric buttons and basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %). Ensure the app is responsive and can be deployed in any modern web browser.
- Research and compare the top 10 open-source frameworks for building scalable data-driven applications. For each framework, summarize its core features, supported programming languages, scalability, community support, and notable real-world use cases. Present your analysis in a comparative table and recommend the most suitable option for enterprise environments.
- Implement a modular Python data pipeline where each module handles a specific sub-task such as data ingestion, cleaning, transformation, storage, or visualization. Provide code snippets, architectural diagrams, and clear documentation for each module.
- Investigate the latest techniques in prompt engineering for Large Language Models (LLMs). Map out different prompt strategies, evaluate their effectiveness, and identify the types of tasks they are best suited for. Include references to recent research papers and open-source tools.
- Prepare a research report on integrating modern data platforms with existing enterprise data warehouses. Identify key challenges, best practices, and case studies demonstrating measurable business outcomes. Propose a step-by-step migration plan for seamless integration.
- Build a RESTful API codebase that enables CRUD operations on a graph-based data store (e.g., Neo4j). Ensure the API supports authentication, versioning, and efficient querying. Provide comprehensive endpoint documentation with example requests and responses.
- Create a simple game app of your choice that has some logic and has a points table which tracks the points that are scored by the user. Iteratively enhance each code file that you generate and create the most efficient version of the same.
